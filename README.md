# Skin-Disease-Detection-System
#Skin diseases are hazardous and often contagious, especially melanoma, eczema, and
#impetigo. These skin diseases can be cured if detected early. The fundamental problem with it is, only
#an expert dermatologist is able to detect and classify such disease. Sometimes, the doctors also fail to
#correctly classify the disease and hence provide inappropriate medications to the patient. Our paper
#proposes a skin disease detection method based on Image Processing and Deep Learning Techniques.
#Our system is mobile based so can be used even in remote areas. The patient needs to provide the
#image of the infected area and it is given as an input to the application. Image Processing and Deep
#Learning techniques process it and deliver the most accurate output. In this paper, we present a
#comparison of two different approaches for realtime skin disease detection algorithm based on
#accuracy. We have compared Navies Bias Classifier. The results of real-time testing are presented.
